# Payroll Calendar Generator

This repository contains a single-page web application that generates payroll calendars (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

Features implemented:

- Inputs: Payment frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), Date of Last Payment, Payment amount (optional).
- Continuous scrollable months: render more months with "Load More Months".
- Printable year layout: 3 columns x 4 rows (January–March in the first row) designed to fit on Legal paper using browser print.
- Major US holidays highlighted (pink): New Year's Day, MLK Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas.
- Paydays highlighted (green outline) and month totals shown. Year totals shown in the summary bar.

How to run locally

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (no server required), or run a lightweight static server.

   Example using Python (PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   python -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```

How to use

- Choose a payment frequency.
- Set the "Date of Last Payment" to anchor the schedule (this determines day-of-week and monthly anchor).
- (Optional) Enter the payment amount to calculate month and year totals.
- Click "Render Scroll" to render months beginning from the current year.
- Click "Load More Months" to append more months for continuous scrolling.
- To print a full year: choose the year in the "Year for print" selector, click "Render Year (print layout)", then click "Print" (or use your browser print dialog). The printed layout is arranged 3x4.

Notes and assumptions

- For weekly/bi-weekly frequencies, paydays are generated by stepping forward/backward from the provided "last payment" date using 7 or 14 day intervals.
- For monthly frequency, the same day-of-month as the anchor is used. If a month doesn't have that day (e.g., 31st), the payday for that month is skipped.
- Month totals include only complete paychecks whose date falls inside that month (partial paychecks crossing month boundaries are not included).
- The UI uses vanilla JavaScript and the `dayjs` library via CDN for convenience.

If you'd like enhancements (CSV export, support for holiday observance rules, configurable money formatting, or React-based UI), tell me which and I will implement them.
